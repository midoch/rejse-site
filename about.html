              Values such as reliability, honesty, credibility, and integrity
              are not empty words to us, but permeate our corporate DNA. This is
              the standard we apply when developing our strategic compliance
              measures, creating a value culture which must be jointly supported
              and consistently lived by all employees – and in particular our
              managers. A written code of values provides the basis for our
              decisions.

              Over the last few months, we’ve defined our Purpose and
              re-evaluated the strategy behind it. We then set new near-term
              priorities, directly aligned to our strategy, and established
              Behaviours to support our long-standing company Values.
